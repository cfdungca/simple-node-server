document.getElementById('container').innerHTML = '<p style="font-family:arial; text-indent:50px; text-align:justify">In searching or say <i>googling</i>, you are actually surfing the whole web.  There are a lot of thousands of files connected to another to another and so on.  Then how does the google decide on which files to show us.  They do it through ranking.  The ranking of the thousand of files are based on how many times the term appeared on the page, does it have synonyms on the page, the quality of the website, the number of time the page was visited, and more.  This could happen in less than a second.  For the layout of <i>Google</i>, they put the title, a snippet of the text, URL, and some related terms.  On the right side and top, we  could find ads.  But ofcourse, not always.  Since Google only shows ads for terms that were searched that would be very helpful for the surfer.</p><p style="font-family:arial; text-indent:50px; text-align:justify">The first search engine in history is called <i>"Archi"</i> as in archive.  Through time, a lot of search engines came into the scene until came <i>Yahoo</i>.  But this Yahoo seems like a directory.  Could you imagine that during those times they are actually human indexing.  As in they are manually putting everything and they even had a book like the yellow pages.  Good thing <i>Google</i> was born.  And <i>algorithmic indexing</i> was born.  As I explained above how Google ranks its links of files, there is still some things not good abot it.  It could happen that the first result may not have the better content but it just so happen that possibly a lot of sites are linking onto it.  This is what they call <i>SEO</i> (Search Engine Optimization).</p>'
