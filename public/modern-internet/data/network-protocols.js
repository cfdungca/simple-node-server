document.getElementById('container').innerHTML = '<p style="font-family:arial; text-indent:50px; text-align:justify">A lot of things happen with a click to get information from the internet.  By opening a file over the internet or by clicking over something, it means you want a request for connection.</p><p style="font-family:arial; text-indent:50px; text-align:justify">The flow of information is broken down into <i>packets</i>.  These packets then go into a somewhat container of IP packets with unique address and type of packet.  These packets then flow over <i>LAN</i> (Local Area Network).  However, during traffic, files of request may get congested.</p><p style="font-family:arial; text-indent:50px; text-align:justify">These IP packets then go to the <i>router</i>.  The router is quite systematic.  Yes.  However, as it transports the IP packets to their designated networks, some packets may get lost.  As these packets pass through the router, it would find its way to the corporate internet and head for the <i>router switch</i>.  The router switch is like a pinball master which pushes the packets to their ways.  So as the packets follow through their destination, these are being picked up by the <i>network interface</i>.  Then they are being sent to a <i>proxy</i> which seems like a middle man for security purposes.</p><p style="font-family:arial; text-indent:50px; text-align:justify">Once the proxy verifies the URL, the packets are being sent to the internet.  Then their next destination is the <i>firewall</i> which serves as a scanner for security.  Then the packets are being picked up again by routers and sent to narrower networks called <i>bandwidth</i>.  And since it is narrow, not all packets successfully pass through it.  Then tadah!  The packets enter the world of web.  As they pass through a lot of networks and routers, they reach another firewall.  After thorough scans, the packets journey is almost over as it enters the <i>web server</i>.  And by that time, the packets will be opened and unpacked to check the information for request.  Then the packets recycled and ready to filled again by requested information and all over again.  Imagine having a fast internet connection.  Everything happens in just milliseconds!</p><br/><p style="font-family:arial; text-indent:50px; text-align:center">packets -> LAN -> router -> router switch -> network interface -> proxy -> firewall -> bandwidth -> web server</p><br/>'
