        <h3><em>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Btbd17UvtiM"> Home </a></li>
                This movie was just shown last March 2015 but it became one of my favorite movies instantly because it is a very cute, fun, and heart-warming cartoon movie. Funny how it made me laugh and cry at the same time. You should try to watch it. The link will bring you to the youtube video copy of it.
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1E1g9XJ9OI"> Limitless </a></li>
                Here is a link of a 2011 film that will make you think what will happen to you when you become the most intelligent of you, beyond what you expect, and what repercussions it might bring. What I love about this movie is that it would really make you think while making every bit of it as suspenseful as it can be.
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGHDZrTgVes"> Lucy </a></li>
                This movie is quite similiar to Limitless because the protagonist also became very very intelligent. Although on Lucy's part, she could manipulate things, particles, matter, and could even see even the smallest part of a body, anything! She could even see the past during the time of dinosaurs, from Big Bang theory to the present and to the future.

        <h3><em>My Top 3 Favorite Songs</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FhRhzAWzLA"> House Party by Sam Hunt </a></li>
                This song is just so cozy and upbeat. The thing about this is it is not just a country song! Sam Hunt was able to mix some hiphop beats and made it quite a pop song while still maintaining its country feels.
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAaos80oPqg"> Big White Room by Jessie J </a></li>
                Jessie J is just plainly awesome. No words could describe how great she is during live shows. This song is one of my favorite songs of hers. What I love about her songs mostly is the lyrics. They are all inspirational and on point. And with her vocal prowess, just wow! It makes everything perfect.
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkElfR_NPBI"> Black Magic by Little Mix </a></li>
                Little Mix is a British pop girl group who joined X Factor UK. The song is referring to small black magic as "confidence". That what every girl needs are not just make-up and outfits but most of all confidence. Confidence to show how pretty she is inside and out.
