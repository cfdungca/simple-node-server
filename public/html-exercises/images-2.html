        <h1>Roller Coaster Life</h1>
        Since I was a child, I really love to sing. By the age of 2(they say), I could already sing <em>One Moment In Time</em>(ofcourse w/ babyish random words haha!). Here is a picture as proof. I think I was singing 
        <em>A Whole New World</em> that time because of my <em>Alladin</em> costume. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com"><img src="images/baby.jpg" alt="Sing Baby Sing!" width="175px" height="250px"/><br/><br/></a>
         I balanced my singing engagements and academics by joining school choir and singing contests. I am proud to say that our high school choir went to Thailand to compete for a choir competition. 
         I think I got my confidence through singing on stage infront of a lot of people, whether it be in a group or solo. <a href="text-formatting-1.html"><img src="images/high school.jpg" alt="Graduate nako!" width="200px" height="150px"/></a>
         At present, I'm a college student at UPLB and I'm a member of my two beloved organizations: <em>UPLB Economics Society</em>(EconSoc) and <em>Circle K Club of UPLB</em>(CKI). If CKI is quite new to your ears, it is a socio-civic organization 
         dedicated to <br/><br/>help kids throughout the country and the globe because we believe helping them also mean helping develop the world's future. These organizations helped and is helping be to become who I am and who I wanted to be in the future: a 
         career woman with a heart to help out to the community and enrich our today's and future's economy, for the betterment of everyone. <a href="images-1.html">

         Here is how I see myself probably in the next five years. Dreaming big, aiming high. Not just for myself but also to our country. <a href="http://www.google.com">

         Ofcourse I would also want my singing career to be on the side. ;) I wouldn't leave that. Haha! One of my dreams is also to become a total performer!
