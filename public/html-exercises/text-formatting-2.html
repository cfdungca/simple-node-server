            My name is <strong>Charisse F. Dungca.</strong> You can call me <em>Cha.</em> I was born on July 10, 1995 in Manila. I am always the shortest pupil in the classroom since kinder. Haha!

            I graduated from <abbr title="University of the Philippines Rural High School">UPRHS</abbr>. I am now a college student at UPLB. I do not have any favorite book. I'd rather choose to read magazines and short articles over the internet. Hmm... Memorable line I learned in school? <br/><br/>
